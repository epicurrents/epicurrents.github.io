## Access

The public alpha version of Epicurrents can be accessed from the following address:

[https://alpha.epicurrents.io](https://alpha.epicurrents.io)

The alpha version can be installed as a progressive web app for easier access. It also works as a standalone version that can be run from a single HTML file. This file can be saved on the device for offline access. Hoewever, due to browser security protocols, the standalone application doesn't have all the capabilities of the progressive web app.
