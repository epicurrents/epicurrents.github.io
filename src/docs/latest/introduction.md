## About the library

Epicurrents is an open-source library for reading, processing and displaying neurophysiological signal data in the web browser. It is modular in design and can be extended with additional file formats and study types. Optional services make it possible to extend the application's functionality with Python and machine learning capabilities, for example.

## Getting started

To get started quickly, check out the [getting started](docs/getting-started) section. It details the different ways of accessing and using the library from an end-user's perspective.

### User interface

The [user interface](docs/user-interface) section contains all the information needed to use the default application UI. The default interface is designed for larger displays, but it is possible to develop dedicated interfaces for mobile devices or speific use cases.
