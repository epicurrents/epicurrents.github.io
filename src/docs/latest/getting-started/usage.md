## Supported platforms

Epicurrents can be run on any operating system and on most modern web browsers. Some features, most notably the SharedArrayBuffer-dependent memory management option and FileSystem API for opening files from the local file system, have only been tested in Google Chrome and MS Edge, and full functionality is currently only supported in Chromium-based browsers.^[Please note that even though Chrome is available on Apple iOS devices, it is not chromium based on those platforms and thus is not supported.]

Even though the Epicurrents as an application is platform-agnostic, many of the features of the default library require either the use of a mouse and keyboard or a touch-screen and some advanced features may not be usable on touch screen devices.

Lack of available memory may limit the availability of features or cause instability. Recommended RAM for tabletop and laptop computers is 8 Gb or higher.
