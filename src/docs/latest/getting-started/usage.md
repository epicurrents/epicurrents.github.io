## Supported platforms

Epicurrents can be run on any operating system and on most modern web browsers. Some features, most notably the SharedArrayBuffer-dependent memory management option and FileSystem API for opening files from the local file system, may not be available on all browsers and platforms. Due to time constraints, advanced features have only been tested in Google Chrome and MS Edge, and full functionality is currently supported in Chromium-based browsers.^[Please note that even though Chrome is available on Apple iOS devices, it is not chromium based on those platforms.]

Even though the Epicurrents as an application is platform-agnostic, some features of the default library require either the use of a mouse and keyboard and some advanced features may not be usable on touch screen devices.

Limited system memory may limit the availability of features or cause instability. Recommended RAM for tabletop and laptop computers is 8 Gb or more.
