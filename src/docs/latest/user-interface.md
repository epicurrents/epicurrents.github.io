## Overview

The application interface is an optional module that can be modified or replaced just as any other module. This offers the flexibility to design interfaces specifically for certain use cases or different device types.

This documentation is about the default application interface.

### Interface parts

The interface consists of four separate parts. The main part is the viewport (that displays the resource) and it is always visible. The other three parts can be displayed or hidden as needed:
- **Menu bar**: This is the part at the very top of the window that includes the *Files* and *Settings* menus, among others.
- **Dataset display**: The dataset display is on the left side of the signal viewport and includes but the dataset selector dropdown and the navigator below it. The dataset display can be fast-toggled from the menu icon (three vertical bars) on the left edge of the resource controls bar (below) and resources in the open dataset can be switched with the arrows next to the menu icon.
- **Resource controls**: Controls for the open resource can be found directly above the viewport.
